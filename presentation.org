CGroups

cgroups (a backronym for control groups) is a Linux kernel feature to
limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O,
etc.) of process groups.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This work was started by engineers at Google (primarily Paul Menage
and Rohit Seth) in 2006 under the name "process containers". In late
2007, it was renamed to "Control Groups" due to the confusion caused
by multiple meanings of the term "container" in the Linux kernel, and
merged into kernel version 2.6.24. Since then, many new features and
controllers have been added, such as support for kernfs, firewalling,
and the introduction of a unified hierarchy.  -- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups][Wikipedia]]
